# ASHMC Webfront

###### Better living without MuddSD

## What is this?

This is the ASHMC (currently) unofficial webfront, v1.1.

The ASHMC webfront allows registered students to vote, learn about events, and get updates from
the ASHMC council.

## How do I contribute?

Fork! Develop feature branches based on the `devleop` branch; pull requests for
`master` will be closed without review.

Our lead(s) use a workflow that's pretty close to nvie's `git-flow` - with a
little jiggering to fit it into a more active development cycle and GitHub.

1. fork off ASHMCDeveloper/Webfront (hereafter, the core)
1. Make a feature branch off of `develop`.
2. code code code.
3. periodically `fetch canon` to keep up to date with the core.
4. commit! push to your fork.
5. submit a pull request
6. profit!

Managers have a slightly different life than regular contributers, but we won't
go into that here.

If you're not into coding (or Python, or Django), 1. what's wrong with you,
and 2. no worries! If you're a student, you can submit bugs, enhancements or
questions. One of the devs will get back to you ASAP.
